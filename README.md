## Image Labels Generator using Amazon Rekognition

This project demonstrates how to build an image labeling tool powered by Amazon Rekognition. Once complete, the tool will automatically recognize and label objects within an image. For example, if you upload a picture of a cat, Amazon Rekognition will detect it and label the image accordingly.
